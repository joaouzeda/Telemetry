# **Telemetry**


# *Project Description*

The objective is to create an equipment monitoring system that allows the 
user to track the voltage and current readings of a system, as well as the
time the system has been in operation. It works by reading analog data from
a shunt, which is published to an MQTT broker in JSON format. The data can be
exported to Prometheus and viewed on a Grafana dashboard. In addition to the
system readings, the project also reads an RFID card and publishes the data
following the same steps as the telemetry data.

# *Project Features*

1. Read the system voltage using a shunt and an INA266
3. Implement an hour meter based on current calculation
4. Read the RFID card
6. Publish all necessary information to the broker

# *Technologies Used*

1. ESP32 
3. MQTT
4. WiFi
6. RTOS
7. Arduino component
9. INA226 + shunt
10. Raspberry pi3
